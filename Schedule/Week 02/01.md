# BEM
1. What is BEM?
	* Blocks Elements Modifiers
	* Naming strategy to help us break down pieces of HTML/CSS
2. Blocks
	* Reusable areas of the page that mean something without its parent element
	* header / footer / navbar
	* Give context to the elements within them
3. Elements
	* Pieces that change based on the block they are inside
	* author section may be different if its in the main-article or read-more block
	* Elements only have meaning within their parent block
4. Modifiers
	* Slight changes to existing blocks or elements
	* Only include the change between the base block/element
	* Recolor buttons, change text alignment, etc
5. Naming Strategy
	* Start with block followed by two underscores, then element name (header__hero-text)
	* Generally, we don't want to use just the block and the element tag name to prevent cascading down and causing problems
	* Modifiers use the same default name, followed by two hyphens and the modifier name (header__hero-text--centered)
	* When using modifiers, you must specify *both* classes for it to work. The modifier only contains the modifications!
