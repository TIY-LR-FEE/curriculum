2. Float layouts

# CSS Box Model
1. height / width
	* defines dimensions
2. margin
	* outside dimensions
	* space _around_ the element
	* personal space, push people away
3. padding
	* inside dimensions
	* additional room within the element
	* fat suit
4. border
	* inside dimensions
5. box-sizing
	* by default set to context-box
	* content-box adds border and padding on top of dimensions
	* width: 50%; padding: 20px = 50% + 20px + 20px
	* border-box calculates border and padding _within_ the dimensions

# CSS display property
1. block
	* "div-like" or container elements
	* appears on their own line (nothing next to them)
	* can have width/height set
	* by default, take up width of parent
2. inline-block
	* the only default inline-block tag is img
	* like block elements, but only take up width of their content
	* will not let text wrap around it
3. inline
	* "span-like" tags
	* width/height are only determined by the content of the element
4. none
	* does what it says. useful for hiding/showing things.
5. There are others! But they're less common.
	* We'll cover display: flex; later


# CSS float layouts
1. float allows block elements to put itself to the first available pixel that it fits inside in its parent element
2. can be set to left or right. That determines the direction of the float.
3. Code Example:

	```html
	<p style="background: #aaa; color: black;">
  	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  	<img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200" alt="placeholder" style="float: right;">
  	Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
  	Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
  	Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
	</p>
	```
4. Unlike inline-block, floated elements aren't on a "line," so text wraps around
5. Floated elements do not tell their height to their parent elements. To fix issues (like image overflow in example), set the overflow property to auto (or anything but visible). Only works on position: relative or position: static children.
6. clear property specifies which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float. left/right/both
