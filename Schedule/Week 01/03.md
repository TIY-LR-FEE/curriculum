# CSS Pseudo Selectors
1. State Based
	* Modify styles when the user is interacting with the element
	* :hover
	* :focus
	* :checked		
2. Element Searching
	* Select more specific elements
	* :first-child
	* :last-child
	* :nth-child(n)
	* Example code:
		```html
			<style>
			.element-search {
			  background: white;
			}

			.element-search li:nth-child(2n) {
			  background: #555;
			  color: white;
			}

			.element-search li:first-child {
			  color: red;
			}

			.element-search li:last-child {
			  color: blue;
			}

			.element-search li:not(:first-of-type) {
			  text-align: right;
			}
			</style>

			<ul class="element-search">
			  <li>Content</li>
			  <li>Content</li>
			  <li>Content</li>
			  <li>Content</li>
			  <li>Content</li>
			  <li>Content</li>
			</ul>			
		```
3. Location Selectors / Pseudo Classes
	* Don't style existing elements, but create sub-elements
	* ::before creates a sub element before the content, but inside the current element
	* ::after creates a sub element after the content, but inside the current element
	* ::first-letter styles the first letter of the text content of an element

# CSS position Property
1. static
	* Default value for position
	* Position is determined only by its box model
	* top/bottom/left/right do nothing
2. relative
	* top/bottom/left/right allow us to push the element from where it would be statically positioned
	* Generally not the best answer for small tweaks to layout
3. fixed
	* Locks an element in place no matter where it is in our HTML or where the user scrolls
	* top/bottom/left/right match the edges of the viewport
	* Doesn't take up room in the parent element
	* "pinned"
4. absolute
	* Finds the first parent element that isn't position: static, then uses that as its comparison point for top/bottom/left/right
	* If all parent elements are statically positioned, positions itself in comparison to the body element
	* Unlike fixed, will change when the user scrolls

# CSS transform property
1. translate
	* Moves element on X/Y-axis
	* transform: translate(50px, 100px) moves it 50px right, 100px down
2. rotate
	* rotates an element clockwise/counter clockwise
	* rotate(20deg)
	* rotate(-20deg)
3. scale
	* scale(2, 3) two times its width, 3 times its height
4. skew, skewX, skewY
	* skew the element on the X or Y axis by degrees
