# Scope
	1. Describes what variables are available where you currently are
	2. Global Scope
	3. Functional Scope
	4. If variables have the same name, JavaScript will choose the one with the closest scope
	5. IFFEs create a new scope to keep from polluting global scope

# Scope
	1. this
	2. bind/apply/call


# Hoisting
	1. Concepts behind hoisting
		* Any variable declared is available at all times within its scope
		* It may not have a value, but it can be referenced
	2. Variables
		* Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope
		* Will not make a reference error in that scope
		* Assignments are not hoisted
	3. Functions
		* The entire function is hoisted to the top of its scope
		* Function expressions are variables, and follow variable rules

# DOM Basics
 1. DOM is not raw HTML
	 * HTML is what the browser interprets to *create* the DOM
	 * Users actually interact with the DOM, not the raw HTML
	 * Each element on the page is actually an individual object that can be changed with JavaScript
 2. DOM manipulation allows us to modify the content of the page *after* it loads
 3. document
	 * Global variable that allows us to access the DOM
	 * Represents everything available to the user, even hidden/invisible elements
 4. document.querySelector
	 * Allows us to grab an element by passing in CSS style Selectors
	 * Only grabs the *first* element that matches
 5. document.querySelectorAll
	 * like document.querySelector, but it returns a NodeList that contains *all* matching elements
	 * NodeList is a crappy Array that only has length. No Higher Order Functions.
	 * Array.from allows us to turn crappy Arrays into real Arrays
 6. innerHTML
	 * Allows us to inspect the contents of the current element
	 * Can assign it to new contents
 7. style
	 * Allows us to create or modify inline styles for the current element
	 * style.property = 'value';
	 * Generally, classes are a better idea than style manipulation

# User Events
 1. JavaScript events allow us to take action when the user interacts with the DOM
 2. addEventListener
	 * All elements have an addEventListener function which lets us add callbacks to events
	 * Takes name of the event and callback to run
	 * Example Code:
		 ```javascript
			 var alertButton = document.querySelector('.alert-button');

			 alertButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
				 alert('button clicked');
			 });			
		 ```
 3. Other Events
	 * submit - when a form is submitted
	 * change - when an input has changed and a user has left focus
	 * mouseover - when the mouse enters the current element or its children
	 * mouseenter - when the mouse enters the current element, but doesn't trigger again until after leaving the entire element
 4. preventDefault
	 * Sometimes we want to override the normal things that happen on an event
	 * preventDefault allows us to prevent clicks from happening, forms from submitting, etc
