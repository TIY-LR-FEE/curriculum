# Introduction to Functional Programming
	1. Minimization of Side Effects
	2. Data In -> Data Out / Immutable Data
		* Functional Functions don't rely on data outside the function, and don't mutate data outside the function
	3. Advantages of map/reduce
		* Turns complex iteration into one-liners
		* Important parts of iteration (collection, operation, return value) are always in the same place
		* Outside data is not effected, new copies are returned. map/reduce don't mutate outside data
		* map/reduce are elemental operations. Small building blocks.

# Higher Order Functions
	1. forEach
		* Side effects for each item in an array
		* Logging each item
		* Adding something to an array or string for each item
	2. map
		* Transform each item in an existing array
		* Should not have side effects, but isn't enforced
	3. filter
		* Get a new array containing only items that match your criteria
		* Internal function must return true/false
		* Should not have side effects, but isn't enforced
	4. reduce

# Complex JavaScript Types
	1. Objects
		* Grouped storage that allows values and functionality to move around together
		* Almost everything is an object behind the scenes
		* Containers of values called properties
		* Properties can be functions, arrays, other objects
		* New properties created automatically when assigned to
		* Use . (property accessor) to access properties
		* Or ['property name'] syntax
		* Functions on objects are called methods

# Scope
	1. Describes what variables are available where you currently are
	2. Global Scope
	3. Functional Scope
	4. If variables have the same name, JavaScript will choose the one with the closest scope
	5. IFFEs create a new scope to keep from polluting global scope

# Hoisting
	1. Concepts behind hoisting
		* Any variable declared is available at all times within its scope
		* It may not have a value, but it can be referenced
	2. Variables
		* Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope
		* Will not make a reference error in that scope
		* Assignments are not hoisted
	3. Functions
		* The entire function is hoisted to the top of its scope
		* Function expressions are variables, and follow variable rules
