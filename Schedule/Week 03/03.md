# Introduction to Functional Programming
	1. Minimization of Side Effects
	2. Data In -> Data Out / Immutable Data
		* Functional Functions don't rely on data outside the function, and don't mutate data outside the function
	3. Advantages of map/reduce
		* Turns complex iteration into one-liners
		* Important parts of iteration (collection, operation, return value) are always in the same place
		* Outside data is not effected, new copies are returned. map/reduce don't mutate outside data
		* map/reduce are elemental operations. Small building blocks.

# Higher Order Functions
	1. forEach
		* Side effects for each item in an array
		* Logging each item
		* Adding something to an array or string for each item
	2. map
		* Transform each item in an existing array
		* Should not have side effects, but isn't enforced
	3. filter
		* Get a new array containing only items that match your criteria
		* Internal function must return true/false
		* Should not have side effects, but isn't enforced
	4. reduce

# Complex JavaScript Types
	1. Objects
		* Grouped storage that allows values and functionality to move around together
		* Almost everything is an object behind the scenes
		* Containers of values called properties
		* Properties can be functions, arrays, other objects
		* New properties created automatically when assigned to
		* Use . (property accessor) to access properties
		* Or ['property name'] syntax
		* Functions on objects are called methods
