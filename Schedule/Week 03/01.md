# JavaScript Fundamentals
1. Syntax terms: document.querySelector('header');
	* document: object
	* .: property accessor
	* querySelector: property (function)
	* (): function call
	* 'header': argument
	* ; end of statement
2. Statements
	* one coherent thought or instruction
	* on own line
	* end with a semicolon
	* does not return a value
3. Expressions
	* like a statement, but returns a value
	* most things are Expressions
	* values, variables, variable declarations/assignments are all expressions
3. Comments
	* single line (potentially after end of a statement)
	* multiline
4. Types
	* Numbers (1, 3.14, -20, 4.5e7)
	* Strings ('Foo', "Bar", "'Foo' Bar", "\"Foo\" Bar")
	* Booleans (true, false)
	* Object (groups values and functionality)
	* Array (ordered grouping of things)
	* Function (repeatable list of instructions)
5. Variables
	* Assigned seats at a concert, one person can buy multiple tickets, multiple seat assignments
	* Declaration (var age;)
	* Assignment (age = 47;)
	* Declare and Assign (var age = 47;)
	* Declare Multiple (var age, favoriteColor, name;)
	* Declare and Assign Multiple (var age = 47, favoriteColor = "green", name = "Bob";)
	* Camel Case
	* First character can only be a letter, $ or _
6. Special values
	* undefined (value that isn't defined)
	* null (object that isn't defined)
	* NaN (number that doesn't make sense)

# JavaScript Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators
	* Basic (+, -, \*, /)
	* Modulus or Remainder Operator (%)
2. Comparison Operators
	* Type Coercion with == (!=)
	* Strict equality with === (!==)
	* Object / Array / Function Reference Equality
	* >, <, >=, <=
	* Falsy values ("", 0, false, undefined, null, NaN)
3. Logical Operators
	* Inverse (!)
	* And (&&)
	* Or (||)
4. Assignment Operators
	* +=, -=
	* ++, --		

* Flow Control
	1. If / Else If / Else
		* controls the flow of JavaScript (flow control)
	2. Switch Statement
		* Easier than nesting a lot of If / Else Ifs for a single variable
		* Example Code:
			```javascript
				switch(foo) {
					case "Here":
						statement;
						break;
					default:
						statement;
						break;
				}
			```
	3. For Loops
